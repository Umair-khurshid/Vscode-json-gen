# Vscode-json-gen
an automated Python script that generates the c_cpp_properties.json file for VS Code, fully automating the setup process based on the current Make build configuration. The tool reads the build system settings, such as the includePath, defines, and compilerPath, and updates the c_cpp_properties.json file accordingly.
